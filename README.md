# weather-website
 
Welcome to Sky

This is intended to be a Single Page website, intended as a website for weather updates. This will be an iterative, greenfield project. It is intended for me to get familiar with full-stack development, appease my fascination with climate, and hone a focus path within the environmental technology sector.

Here are the features I intend to implement in the initial version v0.1:
- A clean and intutive UI
- A non-live basic weather application customised to Singapore
- Non-live categories for temperature, humidity, weather and rain
- Fixed warnings and advisories afflicting Singapore
- Variations affecting current conditions

In version 1.0, I wish to upgrade capabilities to meet these goals:
- Ability to scrape from conventional live weather reporting sources into:
- Combined weather and expected temperature outlook list
- Current temperature and expected temperature outlook list
- Current weather and expected weather outlook list
- Warnings and advisories 

In subsequent versions with more time, I wish to include: 
- Ability to track user's current location 
- Ability to store cookies to remember use preferences
- Ability to see historical data
- Progress into application based services, or widget capabilities. 

Some notes:
- Aim for image optimisation
